# wait-loop

> **wait-loop** helps to synchronize each async loop call for an array . **wait-loop** works on 'deasync' nodejs event loop blocking mechanism.

A problem arises when we wish to iterate an array and perform an async task on each element but we wish to call next
iteration only after first one is finished working.

`wait-loop` helps in this regard by using node events & deasync event blocking to achieve a synchronous work.

> Note : The following module is helpful for those who are yet to work with bluebird promises as `.each` method in bluebird is good solution for this problem.

To achieve our goal we will use following function -

+ `each` function
    ~~~~~
    each(array,task)
    ~~~~~
    + `array` - is the array of elements on which our loop will work
    + `task` - the function inside which user performs the async task ,there will be two params provided by it. 
        + `element` - element (which is the current array element)
        + `position` - the current index  (you can avoid it if you don't want it)
    + **next()** function is used to switch to next iteration , if there is an error call **next(err)**
    + **on(func)** function will create an active listener which will fire after either all iterations are completed or an error occurred.
        + `func(error)` - it is a function as parameter inside **on**
            + `error` - if the loop succeeds the error will be undefined else it will contain the error 
         
 > Note : Although the **on** is internally using node events but you can start listening to it before or after **each** function. This is due to the internal module(_wait-loop_) handling which will only starts the work after the listener (**on**) is attached.
        
### Example -
~~~~   
    var loop = require('wait-loop');

    loop.each(array, function(elem) {
    
        //an async call to read a file
        require('fs').readFile(elem, 'UTF-8', (err, resp) => {
       
            //call next(err) if there is an error
            if (err)
                loop.next(err); 
            else
                loop.next();
                
        }); //end of read file
    }); //end of loop.each
    
    loop.on(err => {
    //our error should be undefined for successful completion
        if (err)
            //there is an error
        else
            //successfully executed
    });
